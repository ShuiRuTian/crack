# crack
rust debugger, to crack the shell of crap

## Motivation
Why this should exist when we already have GDB/LLDB?

An interesting fact is usually a tool of some language is written by the language itself. This might make it much more simpiler to implement some functions.

And GDB/LLDB might not pritorize some tasks only for rust, but we could.

## Resources
go implments its own debugger for better understanding of language features

rust communicity has one library, although it's not in active developing, it's still a very good example to learn.
